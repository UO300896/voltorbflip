# VoltorbFlip

This is an online recreation of the Voltorb Flip game that appeared in the Game 
Corner in Korean and Western releases of Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver. 
As an avid Pokémon fan who enjoys puzzle games, I decided to recreate the 
minigame for the web as a way to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I developed this using Google Chrome to check my progress, and as a result am 
unsure how it runs in other browsers. If you experience problems running this
please leave a report in the issues tab. I am by no means an expert web developer 
and am absolutely open to any feedback about my creation. Have fun and enjoy!

NODE VERSION:
  Since this is an old project, many node.js versions aren't as easily supported.
  Sharp modules are used, so for new versions of node there could be no pre-compiled binaries.
  In case of troubles while compiling sharp modules, make sure to have Python and Visual Studio Build Tools installed.
  
  To avoid these problems, look for older versions of node!!
  
  From my experience compiling the project, Node 12 has been the one working for me with default binaries, so no additional tools were     requiered.
  I expect Node 10 to work too (not tested tho). 

  GATSBY VERSION:
  Gatsby v2 is used here. So be careful while updating libraries since they could ask for newer vesions (like Gatsby v5)
